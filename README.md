# Summary of Learnings in Module 9
What I've learned in this module was being able to familiarize myself with Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot data. Furthermore, I've understand why box plots are used in stocks, and it is to gain analysis on the financial market trend. In this module, different plots have different usage depending on what situation you are in.
